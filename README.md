It's Pokemon Wordle!

To play, run DisplayGame.py

The criteria to match are:
- Type
- Generation
- Evolution Line Length (ex. Butterfree is 3, Rattata is 2, Tauros is 1)
- Abilities
- BST

BST will indicate whether the Pokemon you're looking for has a higher or lower BST by pointing up or down.

Alternate Forms are included if they change any of the relevant attributes.
Mega Evolutions are included, they do not count as an extra evolution for the Evolution Line Length (Mewtwo is still 1, Charizard is still 3, etc.)

"Show Pokedex" will display a list of all currently valid answers.

Gens 1-8 + Hisuian Forms included.
